Furthermore there is a website to accompany the book with hints and full solutions to all the problems in the book as well as podcasts to accompany each chapter, and supplementary material covering matrix algebra and addressing sources of confusion in the electromagnetic field strength tensor. This is a really helpful feature and can be found HERE."

Chapter 5 starts with advanced definitions of scalars, vectors, and tensors and moves on to consider tensor algebra including outer and inner products and tensor contraction. Next comes the metric tensor and Christoffel symbols and covariant differentiation. This chapter was the highlight of the book for me and I finished it feeling that I had just stepped into a larger world!"

So if you buy a copy in 2021 or later (and I strongly recommend you do) you should be ok. In short this book is a second triumph for Fleisch and will be a joy and triumph for you if you choose to read and study it."
